# PowerShell script that will download the wifi source code from GitHub, extract it to a directory, navigate to that directory, and run the python setup.py install command:


 Here are the steps script will do:

1. Download the wifi source code from GitHub: https://github.com/rockymeza/wifi
2. Extract the downloaded ZIP file to a directory of your choice.
3. Navigate to the directory where you extracted the wifi source code.
4. Run the following command to install the wifi module:


```
$url = "https://github.com/rockymeza/wifi/archive/refs/heads/master.zip"
$location = Get-Location


# Get the base name of the zip file (without the extension)
$zipFileNameWithoutExtension = [System.IO.Path]::GetFileNameWithoutExtension($url)

$outputFolder = "$location\$zipFileNameWithoutExtension"

# Download the ZIP file
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri $url -OutFile "$location\wifi.zip"

# Extract the ZIP file
Expand-Archive -Path "$location\wifi.zip" -DestinationPath $outputFolder

# Navigate to the directory
Set-Location -Path "$outputFolder\wifi-master"

# Install the wifi module
dir
python setup.py install


```
You can modify the $url variable to point to a specific version or branch of the wifi repository if desired, and the $outputFolder variable to specify where you want the files to be downloaded and extracted.
