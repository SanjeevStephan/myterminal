    In PowerShell,
     we can use hashtables as a dictionary-like data structure. Here's an example of how to compare two hashtables in PowerShell:

# Define two hashtables to compare
$dict1 = @{
    "key1" = "value1"
    "key2" = "value2"
    "key3" = "value3"
}

$dict2 = @{
    "key1" = "value1"
    "key2" = "newvalue"
    "key3" = "value3"
}

# Loop through each key-value pair in the first dictionary
foreach ($key in $dict1.Keys) {
    # Check if the key exists in the second dictionary
    if ($dict2.ContainsKey($key)) {
        # If the key exists, check if the value is the same
        if ($dict1[$key] -ne $dict2[$key]) {
            # If the value is different, output a message indicating the change
            Write-Host "Key '$key' has a different value:"
            Write-Host "  Value 1: $($dict1[$key])"
            Write-Host "  Value 2: $($dict2[$key])"
        }
    } else {
        # If the key doesn't exist, output a message indicating the missing key
        Write-Host "Key '$key' is missing in the second dictionary"
    }
}

# Loop through each key in the second dictionary to check for additional keys
foreach ($key in $dict2.Keys) {
    # Check if the key exists in the first dictionary
    if (-not $dict1.ContainsKey($key)) {
        # If the key doesn't exist, output a message indicating the new key
        Write-Host "Key '$key' is new in the second dictionary"
    }
}

.OUTPUT 


.HOW_THE_SCRIPT_WORK

In this example, we define two hashtables ($dict1 and $dict2) to compare. We loop through each key-value pair in $dict1, and for each key, we check if it exists in $dict2. If it does, we compare the values. If they're different, we output a message indicating the change. If the key doesn't exist in $dict2, we output a message indicating the missing key. After we've compared all the keys in $dict1, we loop through each key in $dict2 to check for any additional keys that may not exist in $dict1. 
If we find any, we output a message indicating the new key.
