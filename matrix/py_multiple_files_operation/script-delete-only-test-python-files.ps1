Here is an example code snippet:
-------------------------------{ CODE_BELOW }-----------------------------#>


Get-ChildItem -Filter *.py | Where-Object { $_.Name -like '*test*' } | Remove-Item


 
<#-------------------------------{ CODE_ABOVE }-----------------------------

.OUTPUT 


.HOW_THE_SCRIPT_WORK

In this code, we use the Get-ChildItem cmdlet to get a list of all files in the current directory with a .py extension. We then pipe the list of files to the Where-Object cmdlet to filter out only the files that contain the word 'test' in their name.

Finally, we pipe the filtered list of files to the Remove-Item cmdlet to delete them. Note that this code will delete the files permanently, so use it with caution.
